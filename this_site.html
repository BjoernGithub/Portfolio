      <h3>Sketching</h3>
      <p>
         Every project starts with an idea and this portfolio is no different. Even if it was created for the purpose of showcasing my skill for future employers, I knew from the very beginning that I wanted to make this my own. More than just literally being my portfolio.

               After putting a few thoughts on the table, I came to the idea of making my portfolio resemble a social media platform. More specifically, I wanted it to resemble an artistic platform like Deviantart or Instagram - with a profile picture, bio and everything.
            <br>
               And so, I started sketching out my idea, working to make the inspiration clear, but the look unique. Once I was done and happy I had to bring in some colors.
            <br>
            <img class="small" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/918859103437209660/918860075181961216/IMG_3586.png" alt="moodboard">
               I went through a few palettes, making moodboards for each of them. Then I had to decide which one to continue with. It took a bit of asking around, but somewhere I had a feeling which one I'd be using.
               The bluish and purple colors of this palette was much more relaxing and easy on the eyes than the others I had thrown around. But my gut feeling had definitely came from the image that I got the colors from.
               To this day it's been one of my favorite photographs that I've taken!
            <br>
               And like that, I was ready to take the project to the next step.

         With my idea and colors ready,  it was time to take the project to the digital world.

               I did this with help from Adobe XD, going through three stages of the design.
               These were of course a wireframe in grayscale to get a feel for the layout of the portfolio and where the text and images would be. A mockup where I added colors and the most important images to the wireframe until I was happy with it. And finally... the big step of turning it into a functional prototype.
            <br>
               Here, XD becomes very useful with its prototype tool. Not only could I make the different pages look exactly how I wanted them for the actual website, but I could also link them together to look work like an actual website!
            <br>

               It really looks like a mess of tentacles, but it works.
            <br>
               But after hours of connecting everything together, I had a fully working prototype of what my website would look like and how it would work (in a mobile size, but good enough).
            <br>
               With that, I was ready to start coding the actual website.

         Now was the time to actually create the website that you're looking through right now!

               Going in, I already knew which new challenges I was going to be facing. But I also knew how I wanted to approach them to get through them the best way possible.
            <br>
               Everything from a root with all my colors and fonts, to creating a blank page to work off of with every new page - I felt prepared. And of course I had to change the look of the website to fit every different screen size. Mobile all the way to desktop.
            <br>
               However, all thes things were tools and tricks that I had worked with before during my time at Zealand...
            <br>
            <img class="small" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/922038011439484948/922069873415311411/unknown.png" alt="java">
               The real test of my skill came into play when I had to learn the javascript used for, well, the pages you're looking through right now!
            <br>
               I knew from the start that I wanted a read more option on these pages, before I had to make 10 more pages for each project (whew). But it turned out that the one small button that you see below, is a bit more complicated than it looks.
               Well, it uses javascript... which I had never dared to touch before now. But now I had to push myself to try. I wasn't about to step back already.
            <br>
               And with help from <a class="p_link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3schools</a> I was quickly able to find a simple solution to make this button. 
               But then came the next problem. What if I have multiple texts that need to be read more one at a time? All the new buttons kept opening the same first text. So, I had to experiment.
            <br>
               Going back and forth with W3schools tryit tool, I slowly learnt what each part did. And then it suddenly clicked - and worked!
               Now, each button and function has its own number to distinguish them.
            <br>
               It's far from clean, but for a javascript newbie, I'd like to say that I'm proud.
               And I'm ready to learn more of it in the future. Hopefully with a step ahead now that I've tried it before.
