               During the last weeks of September 2021 me and a group of classmates were part of the entrepreneurship competition known as the Startup Mission.
               We were tasked to come up with a product from scratch and create it to whatever extend that we could. And after throwing around ideas of portable desks and mobile travel cards, we came to a much different idea.
            <br>
               A cow that generates 4 movies after being given a streaming service, a genre, year and rating.
            <br>
               Moohvie! Get it?

               In this project I was tasked as the head of product and design.
               During this time I was solely working on a full prototype of how our app would look. Using Adobe XD, this was made nice and simple. And it was possible to link up the pages like an actual website.
            <br>
               And with my app prototype, me and my group were able to proceed and make a (somewhat) finished website.
