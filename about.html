        <h3>Hey, my name is Bj√∏rn...</h3>
        <p>
            And welcome to my portfolio!
            <br>
            I'm a 20 year old digital artist and multimedia designer born and raised in Denmark. I do all from illustrations to character designs for multiple genres. And currently expanding my library of design and webdesign in every way I can while getting my degree.
            <br>
            Sound just right? Go ahead and look through my previous works in <a class="dark_link" href="webdesign.html">Webdesign</a> or <a class="dark_link" href="art.html">Art</a>, which can also be found above. Or you can go right ahead and contact me through my email</p><p class="email">cm.bjergbakke@gmail.com.</p><p>

        <h3>"What can you do?"</h3>
        <p>
            I'd like to say that I can do a good amount of things.
            <br>
            I've only been doing webdesign for a few months, but any skill has to start from the beginning. I would never have called myself very tech-savvy before starting on my degree. But now I can say that I might just have a new interest that I'm only excited to get better and better at.
            <br>
            On the other side, I've been doing digital art for over 10 years (wow!). I'm mostly self taught in digital art from following other artists online ever since I first started. I do mostly character design fitting for any genre between apocalyptic to fantasy. And do my own original stories and settings. But I continue to look forward to the new projects I may do in the future.

        TRIVIA: Ironically enough, Bear is an ox rather than a bear. This was because I bought a figurine of an ox while designing him.

        <h3>"What experience do you have?"</h3>
        <p>
            Over the years I have acquired a few experiences under my belt - and got room for many more to come!
            <br>
            With the regular 10-year danish school exam behind me, I finally graduated from the HF programme in the first half of 2021. After having chosen arts and mathematics as my higher focus for the final exams. With this, I felt that I already had a clear vision of what I wanted to do. Something creative! But alas, after getting my application for The Animation Workshop located in Viborg rejected, I found myself needing to find something else.
            <br>
            After being at a loss for a while, I came by the term "multimedia designer". And with a closer look I decided it was worth a try. Even if I didn't have the best knowledge for computers. And here I am now! With a completely new interest in coding and design after a few months as a multimedia designer at Zealand business academy.
            <br>
            And how can I forget my experiences with art? My journey hasn't been quite as professional as my short start with coding, but I've definitely gathered some knowledge over the years. My skill lies mostly on a tablet with drawing programs such as Procreate. But upon starting at Zealand, I've since added the whole Adobe package to my arsenal. It's still a lot of new things to learn, but Photoshop and Illustrator won't best me for long.
