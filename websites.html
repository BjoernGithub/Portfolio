                  During the last weeks of September 2021 me and a group of classmates were part of the entrepreneurship competition known as the Startup Mission.
                  We were tasked to come up with a product from scratch and create it to whatever extend that we could. And after throwing around ideas of portable desks and mobile travel cards, we came to a much different idea.
                  <br>
                  A cow that generates 4 movies after being given a streaming service, a genre, year and rating.
                  <br>
                  Moohvie! Get it?
               </p>

                  In this project I was tasked as the head of product and design. The cow itself wasn't of my own mind, but the design of our app certainly was.
                  Throughout the project I was singlehandedly working on the finished prototype of our app, with colors and all. As well as pitching in the concept of letting users save their movies and how that would look.
                  While our app isn't quite a reality yet, our website does have the look that we wanted it to. Even if it only generates the same 4 movies. This time around I wasn't the one in charge of coding, but my prototype definitely went over to the design of the website.

         <h3>Happy Feet</h3>
         <p>
            Not everyone has heard of the term linedance, but those that have, would probably call it old-fashioned. But here's a vision on how to change that...
         </p>

                  For my third ever website to work on, me and my group were actually given another group's website to work on. With a twist - we had to turn their mobile size website into desktop size.
                  And with full freedom to change the look of their website however we wanted.
                  <br>
                  This started with the colors.
                  <br>
                  <img class="small" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/922038011439484948/922125490117029958/image0.jpg" alt="moodboard">
                  Before we got our hands on the Happy Feet website that the last group had created, it was sporting a "grafitti hip-hop" palette.
                  But since Happy Feet is meant to show how a school for linedance could look, we felt that it might need a different pallete. Also since the colors were too busy to look at.
               </p>
               <p class="more">
                  And so, we all started making moodboards.
                  <br>
                  And believe it or not; we all had the idea of cowboys with a blue and orangey palette. So that's what we continued with.
               </p>
               <p class="more">
                  <img class="small" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/922038011439484948/922116148273741894/unknown.png" alt="happy feet">
                  Once we collected the palette that we wanted to use, it was time to put it into the website.
                  <br>
                  Starting off, we simply changed the colors and inserted our own logo in the mobile size that the last group had made. Of course fixing some things along the way.
                  And like that we had our start and it was time to switch up all the images and get started with media queries to make the website suitable for both mobile and desktop.
               </p>
               <p class="more">
                  To end the project, as the head of coding I had to connect all our pages together. And making sure everything worked as it should, of course.

         <h3>Zealand Balletschool</h3>
         <p>
            Do you think ballet is too girly? Do you want to dance ballet, but scared of being called girly? We're here to try and change that.

                  In my first project relating to a realistic scenario, me and my group were tasked to create a website for a dance school - for one specific dance style. Ballet.
                  And beside this, we had to find a problem to tackle that related to the dance style. 
                  <br>
                  But with ballet, we were pretty quick to find which problem to have a go at.
                  <br>
                  We wanted a website that didn't make ballet look like a "girls only" sport.
               </p>

                  With this we immediately went and made a mockup each with Adobe XD for how the website could look.
                  <br>
                  We threw around a few ideas, but ultimately decided to go with a very neutral black and white look. That way no one would be left out.

                  Our second challenge was that our website had to be created for a mobile screen.
                  <br>
                  This meant the introduction of burger menus and completely different styling from what we were used to. But we managed in the end.
               </p>
               <p class="more">
                  And like that, we were done.
                  <br>
                  And we had to say goodbye to our website as another group took over and got the responsibility of finishing the full website. All the way to desktop size.

         <h3>Space Cruise</h3>

            Casual space travel may not be possible anywhere in the near future, but in my very first website project I was able to dive into the idea of... what if?

                  My coding journey starts here!
                  <br>
                  My very first project with making a website with a group was a fun challenge to make a site with one theme in mind. Space travel.
                  <br>
                  We went around with different kinds of brainstorms, coming up with several different ideas until we finally came to a decision.
                  We wanted to make a ship cruise - that went to space!
               </p>
               <p class="more">
                  With this idea we took our limited coding knowledge and started making our website. Each of us with an asigned website.
                  <br>
                  I can't stress enough how proud and amazed I was of this back when I made the facilities page. Just to come back only a few months later and seeing something desperately worth fixing in almost every part of the website.
                  <br>
                  Really makes me proud of how far I've gotten. And I'm only getting better.
